Joint Tracking and Segmentation of Multiple Targets
===================================================

This is a framework for tracking and segmenting multiple targets.
This work is described in the following CVPR 2015 paper [(pdf)](http://www.milanton.de/files/cvpr2015/cvpr2015-anton.pdf)

Installation
==============

This section describes how to get segTracking running on linux.

Install the required dependencies

    sudo apt-get install libgsl0ldbl # Ubuntu

or

    sudo dnf install gsl-devel # Fedora


Get the latest version of the code and cd into that directory

    hg clone https://bitbucket.org/amilan/segtracking
    cd segtracking
    

Start Matlab and run

	installSegTracker;
    
        
Running
=======

	
Now all should be set up. You can start the tracker with.

    stateInfo = swSegTracker('scene','config/scene.ini','params','config/params.ini');
    

The first run will take some time because certain auxiliary structures
need to be recomputed. Subsequent calls will be much faster. The provided
parameter values have not been optimized and need to be adjusted for the
test data.
    
    
    
Other videos
------------

To run the tracker on other videos, adjust the necessary settings in a scene file in 

    scene.ini
    
Parameters can be set in

    params.ini
